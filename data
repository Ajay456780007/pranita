Great Ajay! I read your full project proposal **"Design and Development of Optimized MPPT Control for Solar PV System under Partial Shading Conditions"**. Based on your methodology, objectives, and what MATLAB/Simulink will generate, **I can suggest 20 high-quality graphs** that are commonly used in MPPT + hybrid optimization + partial shading research.

These graphs will make your project look complete, professional, and publication-ready.

K1 is connected between pv array 3 negative and Pv array 4 positive , K2 is connected between the PV1 negative and Pv2 positive , K3 is connected between  Pv2 negative and pv3 postive , K4 is connected between Pv 4 negative and Pv5 positive , K5 is connected between negative of the Pv 5 and postive of Pv6 ,K6 is connected between the pv6 negative and Pv 7 positive K7 is connected between the Pv array 7 negative and Pv array 8 postive , K8 is connected between the negative of pv array 8 and pv array 9 ,  then K9,K10,K11.K12,K13,K14,K15,K16  connects all the postive terminal of the PV 1 to pV 9  and then K17 to k24 connects the negative terminal  we have taken only 22 switches two switchs always on  



What my team leader told is totally i have 9 PV array , so for each PV array i have individual irradiance for all pv arrays , naming from I1 to I9 , so generate different irradiance level from 500 to 1000 like PWM signal for all the variables from I1 to I9 the PWM like irradiance should be different for all the 9 PV arrays , The PWm like irradiance for each variable should be generated for 1 seconds and for 0.01 Timesteps calculate the Power by applying different configuration using the optimization EEl and cuckoo catfish like wise calculate the best voltage configuration for that timesteps and save the best for that timestep in a array and calculate upto 1 second and save the best configuration in the array and at last save the array in the mat file , now  we have the array of shape NO.of Time steps x 22 

Then using clock in the simulation for each timesteps apply that configuration by loading from the mat file and apply the configuration to the switches and run the simulatrion , here  for single PV array the output voltage is  10.14 Amps and 412.666 Voltage for 9 Pv array the total voltage is 3714 V and 10.14Amps  , using this ratings find  for this much percenateg irradiance how will the output will be , using that find the best 22 configuration and  22 configuration , in the sense , K1 to K22 , K1 to K8 is series Connection using this we get the ,maximum power  for single PV array load is 40ohms and for 9 Pv array 360ohms -- This is my team leaders idea whether it is implementable easily





sorry for the typo error my Total  9 pv array generation is 3714 V and 10.14 Amps , Then calculate for single PV array , current remains same  voltage changes , give me the complete logical code to generate and save the best configuration , give me the code for it and also i need to add the Electric EEl optimization for find the best configuration , can you give me the code for it and also guide me how can i add the optimization and save the array the fitness function is Total syatem power (3714 x 10.14 )cc- current power generated , add more precisie logics too , minimum 8 switchs should be on at a time , if more than 8 on make them negative infinitive , give me the code for it and also tell me where i can add the optimization
